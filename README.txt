The purpose of this project is to create a GIMP Plug-in to generate a Cork Jazz Weekend Poster.

Please note that this assignment was completed using a Windows computer. Therefore, there may be permission issues in this plug-in if it is to be run in GIMP on an Apple device. This permission issue can be resolved in the computer’s terminal.

For this assignment, I began by hand sketching a number of thumbnails to aid in developing a final concept to be brought forward to a manual GIMP design. I created a shortlisted of my three favourite thumbnails. I decided to create the three of these thumbnails manually in GIMP to determine which would make the final cut. In summary, the first poster was a torso of a tuxedo with a piano tie and "Cork Jazz" written down the lapel. The second poster was an image looking vertically down on a black grand piano with the cork jazz logo on the top of the piano. The concept here was that looking vertically down on a long grand piano would also look like a pint of Guinness (the piano key as the head of the pint and the black of the piano as the black in a pint glass). Finally, my third poster was a tilted saxophone silhouette with a silhouette of Cork City meant to look like the buttons on the body of the saxophone. I also want to show the music leaving the saxophone, this was when I realised that there was an opportunity to explore the theme of “Art” by imagining the instrument as a paintbrush, the music as the paint and the poster as the canvas. 

My third poster of the saxophone was my favourite. I believed its design showed Creativity, Balance, Emphasis and Rhythm. I used the caption of "Paint the town with Jazz" as a play on "Painting the town red" which I felt added to the rhythm and alignment in the design and emphasised the message of the composition. 

Before starting my code for the Jazz Poster Plugin, I made sure to review my manually created poster in GIMP to determine the sequence in which the code should be written to ensure images are correctly overlapping each other. I also carried out this review to note the different scales, positions and angles of rotation I had applied to my Jazz poster elements.

In my poster, I wanted to add a little something extra by having the Cork Jazz logo being partially overlapped by the “Bloom” leaving the saxophone. I achieved this by having two images for the bloom and an image for one of the “Z” in the Cork Jazz logo. I then sequenced the code to created an overlapping effect in the poster’s title.

Once I found all the elements for my poster, I began positioning them on my poster to replicate what I had manually created with GIMP. I used code that was taught during the lab sessions to begin my code for my plug-in. I included the code to create a background and foreground colour just to show that I understand what was covered in the lab and to meet the assignment requirements. I would then go on to conceal this with a background image. To achieve what I had envisioned for my poster, I had to include additional technical contributions and they are as follows:
1.	I had to rotate a number of elements in my poster. These included the saxophone, Cork silhouette, music blooms and background image. I achieved this by referring to the Python Procedure Browser and searching for the command and arguments to rotate an image. In there I found pdb.gimp_item_transform_rotate. The arguments I needed to specify for the rotation the name of the layer I wanted to rotate, the angle in radians I want I wanted to rotate my selected layer and the point (x and y coordinates) on the layer I wanted to centre the rotation.
2.	I needed to flip my saxophone image on my poster to reflect what I had originally imagined for my final product. Therefore, I again went to the Python Procedure Browser and found that the command pdb.gimp_image_flip would have the desired outcome I was looking for. The arguments required for this command was to specify the name of the image that is to be flipped and on what axis you want to flip it, on the vertical (0) or the horizontal (1) axis. For my poster I wanted to flip it on the vertical axis.
3.	For my poster caption, I wanted to have two colours in my text, white and the Cork Jazz logo red. To do this I, again, went to the Python Procedure Brower and found that pdb.gimp_text_layer_set_color would give me my desired result. The arguments required for this was to specify the name of the text layer I wanted to colour, and provide the Hex for the colour I wanted on this layer.
4.	Finally, I wanted some of my text in the caption to be bold and some text to be bold and italic. I could not find a command to achieve this with pdb in the Python Procedure Browser. Therefore, I began to explore alternate solutions and found that the font style could be added to the font specification in the register, i.e. "Gabriola Bold Italic", and provide me with the result I was looking for.

Once satisfied with the overall final poster I compiled my images used to create my poster with the python script and renamed them with sequence they should be added to assist the end-user when executing the plug-in.

My Jazz Poster plug-in is accessed on GIMP by selecting File->Create->EoghanORiain's Plug-in->Eoghan's Jazz Poster.
